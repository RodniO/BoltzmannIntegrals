# Boltzmann Integrals
Mathematica code for integrating even polynomials of speed in Boltzmann collision integrals.

All the code is in the notebook.
One can choose some predefined polynomials, corresponding to aggregation or bouncing/restitution or define it directly.

All calculations are performed step-by-step.

Allows to find the integrals for both equal and unequal flow speeds.

Can be used to construct differential equations for number density, temperature, viscosity, thermal conductivity and Sonine polynomial expansion (corresponding polynomials are predefined).

More information about applications will be available in my thesis (plan to defend in September 2022).
